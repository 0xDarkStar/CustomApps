// Main plan: Make a simple music playing app
// It will look in a folder that holds all the music
// Make folders for different playlists (Download mp3/mp4 of music [and subtitles if wanted] then put into a folder with song name and artist [ex: Tenellous | Jeremy Blake])
// Allow the user to view both video and subtitles (if possible)
// And be able to download more music (using services like yt-dlp or others that I don't know of) (Those services will have to be downloaded though...)
