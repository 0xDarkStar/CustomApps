# Music Player
## Brief Description
This is an application meant to allow users to playback any songs or videos they have on their computer. Any videos or songs they playback would also show subtitles (if any) for that song or video.
It will allow the user to:
- Create custom playlists
- Shuffle playlists to listen to songs in a randomized order
- Editing of data related to songs (location of files, subtitles to use, title, artist, etc.)
- Playing of songs and music videos
- Delete songs, subtitles, and playlists
- maybe more in the future...

## Supported File Formats
All file formats that I know work with it are:
- MP4
- WEBM
- MP3

## Installation
### Do note, I made this on a Debian-based OS. I have not tested on other OS's.
