# Music Player
## Brief Description
This is an application meant to allow users to download songs from online services onto their computer and listen to their songs through an easy to navigate UI.
It will allow the user to:
- Create playlists
- Shuffle playlists
- Download songs
- Download subtitles for the songs at the same time
- Download subtitles for already downloaded songs (if the user agrees to storing of links)
- Add their own subtitles for already downloaded songs (since some might not have subtitles)
- Getting the links that they used to download the song (if the user agrees to storing of links)
- Playing of songs and music videos
- Delete songs, subtitles, and playlists
- maybe more in the future...
