Main plan: Make a simple music playing app

Services used:
 - yt-dlp [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp]
 - SpotiFlyer [https://github.com/Shabinder/SpotiFlyer]
 - Add more as more services are used!!!

What it will do:
 - Have a folder for all the songs (mp3/mp4) and another folder for all the subtitles (vtt or srt)
 - Search a database to find songs, its paths (to the mp3/mp4 and its subtitles if it has any), and any other data that is needed
 - Allow the user to view both video and subtitles (if possible)
 - And be able to download more music (using services like yt-dlp or others that I don't know of) (Those services will have to be downloaded though...)

How I will go about making it:
 1. Look into a database (SQL) to search for songs and look at their data (title, artist, length, etc.)
 2. Read files (mp3/mp4 and subtitles [vtt and srt]) (At this point, I'd just be outputting to terminal "Found {song} at {path}. Playing..." or something)
 3. Make the UI
 4. Add the pausing, playing, and displaying of music and its data
 5. Add a queue system and skipping (the queue might also include the addition of playlists)
 6. Add the contacting of downloading services (like yt-dlp, SpotiFlyer)
 7. That's all, I think...
