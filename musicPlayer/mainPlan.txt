Main plan: Make a simple music playing app

Services used:
 - yt-dlp [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp]
 - SpotiFlyer [https://github.com/Shabinder/SpotiFlyer]
 - Add more as more services are used!!!

What it will do:
 - Have a folder for all the songs (mp3/mp4) and another folder for all the subtitles (vtt or srt)
 - Search a database to find songs, its paths (to the mp3/mp4 and its subtitles if it has any), and any other data that is needed
 - Allow the user to view both video and subtitles (if possible)
 - And be able to download more music (using services like yt-dlp or others that I don't know of) (Those services will have to be downloaded though...)

How I will go about making it:
 1. Look into a database (SQL) to search for songs and look at their data (title, artist, length, etc.)
 2. Read files (mp3/mp4 and subtitles [vtt and srt]) (At this point, I'd just be outputting to terminal "Found {song} at {path}. Playing..." or something)
 3. Make the UI
 4. Add the pausing, playing, and displaying of music and its data
 5. Add a queue system and skipping (the queue might also include the addition of playlists)
 6. Add the contacting of downloading services (like yt-dlp, SpotiFlyer)
 7. That's all, I think...

 File naming:
    Songs:
        {Song ID}.{file type}
    Subtitles:
        {Sub ID}{Language}.{file type}

 Playlists and songs:
  Adding a song to a playlist:
    From a playlist:
        They would click the "Add song" button.
        It would then open a pop-up that shows all songs that are downloaded.
        It would be possible to search through the songs and download new songs and immediately add it to a playlist.
        Once a song is chosen, it will modify the SQL table controlling the songs in playlists to add the song.
    From a song:
        They would choose to click the "Add to playlist" button when looking at a specific song (like when listening to it or hovering over it).
        It would then open a pop-up showing all the playlists.
        Once one is chosen, it will check if the song is already in there. If it is, ask them if they're sure since it's already in the playlist. Otherwise, just add it in the SQL table.
    From downloading a song:
        They would input the link, what subtitles they want, and what playlist to put it in (if any).
        Once downloaded, the song will be added to the playlist in the SQL table.
  Downloading songs:
    When downloading a song, they'd be able to choose what languages they want and what playlist to put it in.
    If they don't choose any subtitles, no subtitles are downloaded.
